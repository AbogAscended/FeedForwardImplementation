# FeedForwardImplementation
Basic Feed Forward Neural Network Implementation with ReLU activations and MSE loss for uni-variate regression. This uses the data set from Dont Overfit II which is a kaggle completition thats a bit dated now.
Both the training and test csv files are included in the repository, all you need to do is clone and then run the close via jupyter notebook and it will work. Despite the name dont overfit this model largely overfits as it does not
include drop out or regularization other than using batches.
